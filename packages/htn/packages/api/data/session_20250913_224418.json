No matches have been made yet.\n   \n   - **Priority Tasks:** The primary task is to identify high-confidence matches between bank statement entries and GL entries. This involves analyzing the data to find entries that correspond closely in terms of amount, date, and description.\n   \n   - **Helpful Actions:** To assist the user effectively, we need to start by examining the data for obvious matches. This includes looking for entries with identical or closely matching amounts and dates. High-confidence matches will reduce the workload for manual verification later.\n\n   - **Improving the Process:** By focusing on high-confidence matches first, we can quickly reduce the number of unmatched entries, making it easier to address more complex cases later.\n\n2. **Specific Action:**\n\n   - **Action:** Begin by sorting both the bank statement entries and the GL entries by date and amount. Then, perform an initial pass to identify entries with exact matches in both date and amount. These are likely to be high-confidence matches.\n   \n   - **Steps:**\n     - Extract the date and amount from each bank statement entry.\n     - Extract the date and amount from each GL entry.\n     - Compare these pairs to find exact matches.\n     - Document these matches for further verification.\n\n3. **Confidence Level:**\n\n   - **Confidence Level:** 0.9\n\n   This approach is straightforward and relies on objective data points (date and amount) to identify high-confidence matches. It is a standard initial step in reconciliation processes, thus I am highly confident in its effectiveness.",
