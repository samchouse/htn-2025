No matches have been made yet.\n   \n   - **Priority Tasks:** The highest priority is to identify high-confidence matches between the bank entries and GL entries. This will help in reducing the number of entries that need further investigation.\n   \n   - **Data Analysis:** Start by examining the data structure of both the bank and GL entries. Look for key attributes such as transaction date, amount, and description that can be used for matching.\n   \n   - **High-Confidence Matches:** Focus on identifying entries with exact matches in amounts and dates first, as these are likely to be high-confidence matches.\n\n2. **Specific Action to Take:**\n\n   - **Data Review:** Review the bank statement and GL entries to understand their structure and key attributes.\n   \n   - **Initial Matching:** Perform an initial pass to identify entries with exact matches in transaction amounts and dates. This will help in quickly identifying high-confidence matches.\n   \n   - **Document Matches:** Document any matches found during this initial pass for further review and confirmation.\n\n3. **Confidence Level:**\n\n   - **Confidence Level:** 0.9\n\n   This approach is based on standard reconciliation practices, focusing on high-confidence matches first to streamline the process. By identifying exact matches in amounts and dates, we can quickly reduce the number of entries needing further investigation.",
