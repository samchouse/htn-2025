No matches have been made yet.\n   \n2. **Priority Tasks:** The first priority is to identify high-confidence matches between bank entries and GL entries. This involves looking for entries with matching amounts, dates, and descriptions.\n\n3. **User Assistance:** The user would benefit from a structured approach that identifies potential matches quickly and efficiently. This will help in reducing the workload and focusing on discrepancies later.\n\n4. **Improving the Process:** By starting with high-confidence matches, we can narrow down the entries that need further investigation, thereby streamlining the reconciliation process.\n\n**Action:**\n\n1. **Data Analysis:** Begin by sorting both the bank entries and GL entries by date and amount. This will help in quickly identifying potential matches.\n\n2. **Identify High-Confidence Matches:** Look for entries where the amount and date match exactly between the bank statement and the GL. These are typically the easiest to confirm as matches.\n\n3. **Documentation:** Keep a record of these matches to ensure they are not re-evaluated in subsequent iterations.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 0.9\n\nThis approach is highly likely to yield initial matches, as exact matches on amount and date are usually straightforward and reliable. This will set a solid foundation for addressing more complex discrepancies in subsequent steps.",
