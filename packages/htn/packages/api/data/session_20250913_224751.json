This will help narrow down the entries that need further investigation.\n   - Provide a clear and concise summary of these potential matches to the user for review.\n\n4. **Improving the Matching Process:**\n   - Use a systematic approach to compare each bank entry with the general ledger entries.\n   - Consider using a scoring system to rank the confidence level of each potential match based on the similarity of attributes.\n\n**Specific Action:**\n\n- **Action:** Begin by examining the bank statement entries and general ledger entries side by side. Identify key attributes such as transaction date, amount, and description/reference. Look for exact matches or very close matches in these attributes to identify high-confidence matches. Document these potential matches for further review.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 0.8\n\n- I am confident that starting with high-confidence matches based on key attributes is a logical first step. This approach will help streamline the reconciliation process and focus efforts on entries that require more detailed analysis.",
