No matches have been made yet.\n\n2. **Priority Tasks:**\n   - Identify high-confidence matches between bank entries and GL entries.\n   - Focus on entries with unique identifiers or amounts that can be easily matched.\n   - Look for exact matches first, such as identical transaction amounts and dates.\n\n3. **Helpful Actions for the User:**\n   - Start by sorting both sets of entries by transaction amount and date.\n   - Identify any unique transaction amounts that appear only once in both the bank and GL entries, as these are likely high-confidence matches.\n   - Consider any additional information such as transaction descriptions or reference numbers that could aid in matching.\n\n4. **Improving the Matching Process:**\n   - Use a systematic approach to ensure no entries are overlooked.\n   - Document any assumptions or criteria used for matching to maintain transparency.\n\n**Specific Action:**\n\n- **Sort and Compare:** Begin by sorting both the bank statement entries and the GL entries by transaction amount and date. Identify any unique transaction amounts that appear only once in both lists, as these are likely candidates for high-confidence matches.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 0.9\n\nThis approach is systematic and focuses on high-confidence matches first, which is a logical starting point for reconciliation. It leverages the most straightforward matching criteria, which should yield initial results quickly.",
