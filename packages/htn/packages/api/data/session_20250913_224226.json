No matches have been made yet.\n   \n   - **Priority Tasks:** The highest priority is to identify high-confidence matches between bank entries and GL entries. This involves looking for entries that have the same amount, date, and description, as these are often indicative of a direct match.\n   \n   - **Helpful Actions for the User:** Providing a list of potential high-confidence matches will help the user quickly reconcile entries and focus on more complex discrepancies later.\n\n   - **Improving the Matching Process:** To improve the matching process, we should first filter entries that have identical amounts, as these are the most straightforward matches. Then, we can refine the search by looking at dates and descriptions.\n\n2. **Specific Action to Take:**\n\n   - **Action:** Begin by sorting both the bank statement entries and the GL entries by transaction amount. Identify entries with identical amounts. For these entries, further compare the transaction dates and descriptions to confirm potential matches. Document these high-confidence matches for user review.\n\n3. **Confidence Level:** 0.9\n\n   - **Justification:** Sorting by amount is a logical first step as it narrows down potential matches quickly. This method is generally effective in identifying straightforward matches, especially when the transaction amounts are unique or uncommon. My confidence is high, but not absolute, as there may be exceptions or additional context needed for certain entries.",
