Then, perform an initial scan to identify any exact matches in both amount and date. Document these matches and reduce the pool of entries for further analysis.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 0.9\n\nThis approach is a standard initial step in reconciliation processes and should yield high-confidence matches quickly, allowing us to focus on more complex discrepancies in subsequent steps.",
