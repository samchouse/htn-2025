No matches have been made yet.\n   - **Priority Tasks:** The primary task is to identify high-confidence matches between bank entries and GL entries. This involves comparing amounts, dates, and descriptions to find direct matches.\n   - **User Needs:** The user needs a clear and efficient way to reconcile these entries, starting with the most obvious matches to reduce the workload.\n   - **Improvement:** By focusing on high-confidence matches first, we can quickly reduce the number of unmatched entries, making it easier to address more complex cases later.\n\n2. **Specific Action:**\n\n   - I will start by examining the bank statement entries and GL entries to identify potential matches based on:\n     - **Exact Amount Matches:** Look for entries with the same transaction amount.\n     - **Date Proximity:** Check if the transaction dates are close enough to suggest a match (e.g., within a few days).\n     - **Description Similarity:** Analyze the transaction descriptions for keywords or patterns that suggest a match.\n   - I will create a list of potential high-confidence matches based on these criteria.\n\n3. **Confidence Level:**\n\n   - I have a confidence level of **0.8** in this decision. This approach is a standard initial step in reconciliation processes and should yield a good number of matches, allowing us to focus on more complex discrepancies later.\n\n**Next Action:** Begin by analyzing the bank and GL entries for exact amount matches, date proximity, and description similarity to identify high-confidence matches.",
