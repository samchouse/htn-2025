      "reasoning": "1. **Reasoning:**\n   - We are in the initial phase of the reconciliation process where no matches have been made yet. The primary goal is to identify high-confidence matches between the bank statement entries and the general ledger (GL) entries.\n   - The highest priority task is to analyze the data to identify potential matches. This involves looking for entries that have the same or similar amounts, dates, and descriptions.\n   - It is crucial to start with high-confidence matches to reduce the complexity of the reconciliation process. High-confidence matches typically involve exact matches in amounts and close matches in dates.\n   - Understanding the structure of the data, such as the fields available (e.g., date, amount, description), will guide the matching process.\n\n2. **Specific Action:**\n   - Begin by reviewing the bank statement entries and GL entries to identify entries with exact or near-exact amounts. This is often the most straightforward indicator of a potential match.\n   - For each bank entry, list potential GL entries that have the same or very similar amounts. Note any entries that also have matching or closely matching dates.\n   - Document these potential matches for further analysis. If possible, sort them by confidence level based on the criteria (e.g., exact amount match, date proximity).\n\n3. **Confidence Level:**\n   - I have a confidence level of 0.8 in this decision. This is a standard initial step in reconciliation, and focusing on high-confidence matches will streamline the process. However, the actual success will depend on the quality and structure of the data provided.\n\nBy taking these steps, we can efficiently narrow down the list of potential matches and make the reconciliation process more manageable.",
