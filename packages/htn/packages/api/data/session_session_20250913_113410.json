No matches have been made yet.\n   \n   - **Priority Tasks:** The highest priority is to identify high-confidence matches between bank entries and GL entries. This will help in reducing the number of entries to be manually reviewed later.\n   \n   - **Helpful Actions:** To facilitate this, I should first examine the data structure of both sets of entries. This includes understanding the key fields available for matching, such as dates, amounts, and descriptions. Identifying any unique identifiers or reference numbers that can directly link entries would be particularly useful.\n   \n   - **Improvement in Matching Process:** By focusing on high-confidence matches initially, I can quickly reduce the number of entries that need further analysis. This will streamline the reconciliation process and make it more efficient.\n\n2. **Specific Action:**\n\n   - I will start by reviewing the bank statement entries and general ledger entries to identify key fields for matching. I will look for:\n     - Exact matches in transaction amounts.\n     - Matching transaction dates within a reasonable range.\n     - Descriptions or reference numbers that are common between entries.\n   \n   - Once these fields are identified, I will attempt to find high-confidence matches based on these criteria.\n\n3. **Confidence Level:** 0.9\n\n   - I am confident that examining the data structure and identifying key fields for matching is the correct first step in the reconciliation process. This approach is standard practice and should yield initial high-confidence matches, setting a solid foundation for further analysis.",
