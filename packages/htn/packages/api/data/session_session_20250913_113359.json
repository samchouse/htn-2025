This involves:\n     - Sorting both sets of entries by date and amount.\n     - Looking for exact matches in amounts and dates between the bank statement entries and GL entries.\n     - Flagging these matches for further review or confirmation.\n\n3. **Confidence Level:**\n   - 0.9 (High confidence)\n   - I am confident that starting with high-confidence matches based on exact amount and date matches is a standard and effective approach in reconciliation processes. This will streamline the reconciliation process by quickly identifying straightforward matches.",
